// Problem Statement

//     Qahadi is playing with numbers.He loves unique numbers and wants them a lot.He has some numbers,
//     and it is possible that there are some duplicates.So, he wants to remove those duplicate numbers.

//                                                           In a move he can remove a number that is currently in the list more than once.Can you tell how many moves does he need to make all the numbers unique.

//                                                           For example,

//     If Qahadi had the numbers 1, 5, 10, 5, 2, 5, 10, 5, 1;
// then he will need 5 moves to remove 1, 5, 5, 5, 10 from the list and make the list : 1, 5, 10, 2 where all of the values are unique.

//                                                                                                Input Format

//                                                                                                    First line will contain T,
//     the number of test cases.First line of each test case will contain N, the size of the list.Second line of each test case will contain the list A of size N.Constraints

//                                                                                   1 <= T <= 100 1 <= N <= 10 ^
//                                                                               4 - 10 ^ 9 <= A[i] <= 10 ^ 9;
//     Here A[i] means the values of the list.Output Format

//         Output how many moves does he need to make the list unique.
